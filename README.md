        README.md file explaining the purpose of the repo, along with local setup instructions.
              
        Explicitly maintaining dependencies in a file ex (pom.xml, build.gradle, go.mod, requirements.txt, etc).
              
        Makefile to build and run the REST API locally.
              
        Ability to run DB schema migrations to create the student table.
              
        Config (such as database URL) should not be hard-coded in the code and should be passed through environment variables.
              
        Postman collection for the APIs.

API expectations
        Support API versioning (e.g., api/v1/<resource>).
        
        Using proper HTTP verbs for different operations.
        
        API should emit meaningful logs with appropriate log levels.
        
        API should have a /healthcheck endpoint.
        
        Unit tests for different endpoints.

<summary><b>2 - Containerise REST API</b></summary>
<!-- Include details for Milestone 2 here -->
  
  ## Learning Outcomes

  Learnt how to Dockerise an application.

  Learnt about Mutli-stage Dockerfile.

  Learnt about Dockerfile best practices.

## Problem Statement
Create Dockerfile for the REST API.
## Expectations


    1) API should be run using the docker image.

    2) Dockerfile should have different stages to build and run the API.

    3) We should be able to inject environment variables while running the docker container at runtime.

    4) README.md should be updated with proper instructions to build the image and run the docker container.

    5) Similarly appropriate make targets should be added in the Makefile.

    6) The docker image should be properly tagged using semver tagging, use of latest tag is heavily discouraged.

    7) Appropriate measures should be taken to reduce docker image size. We want our images to have a small size footprint.

<summary><b>3 - Setup one-click local development setup</b></summary>

## Problem Statement
  We want to simplify the process of setting up API on the local machine for development. The idea is to enable other   team members to run the API and its dependent services with the least amount of steps involved in getting this up and running. 
  
We wonâ€™t be assuming that other team members have the required tools already installed on their local. So we will be going one step further and providing them with simple bash functions to install the required tools.
## Expectations

  1)  API and its dependent services should be run using docker-compose.
    
  2)  README.md file should be updated with instructions
     
       i) To add pre-requisites for any existing tools that must already be installed (e.g., docker, make, etc)
      
  3)  When we run the make target to start the REST API docker container,
     
       i) Later it should invoke the docker compose command to start the API docker container and dependent services
